# Comparison simulations of pulseq-CEST with Bloch-McConnell fit

Simulations of yaml files from pulseq-CEST-library (https://github.com/kherz/pulseq-cest-library)

The simulations with pulseq-CEST are done with the used seq files for the measurement. To simulate Z spectra, the MATLAB script sim_seq_files.m can be used.
It has to be mentioned that for the Bloch-McConnell fit a noise constant is introduced. This is not considered in the pulseq-CEST simulation.
